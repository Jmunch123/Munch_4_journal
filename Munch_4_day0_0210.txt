1.  Making the orb visible after the countdown was added into the code
2.  the direction of where the orb was going also was sort of a difficulty for me 
to fix it so the orb would work

making the orb visible:
 		    thisOrb.settimeExists(7);
                    thisOrb.setX((int) player.x);
                    thisOrb.setY((int) player.y);
                    thisOrb.hitbox.setX(thisOrb.getX());
                    thisOrb.hitbox.setY(thisOrb.getY());
                    thisOrb.setIsVisible(true);
orb direction:
		     if (thisOrb.getDirection() == 0){
                         thisOrb.setX((int) player.x);
                         thisOrb.setY(thisOrb.getY() - 10);
                     }else if (thisOrb.getDirection() == 2){
                         thisOrb.setX((int) player.x);
                         thisOrb.setY(thisOrb.getY() + 10);
                     }else if (thisOrb.getDirection() == 3){
                         thisOrb.setY((int) player.y);
                         thisOrb.setX(thisOrb.getX() - 10);
                     }else if (thisOrb.getDirection() == 4){
                         thisOrb.setY((int) player.y);
                         thisOrb.setX(thisOrb.getX() + 10);
                     }
3.  Also creating another class for the orb was difficult do to changing all of 
the code to follow that of the orbs class
4.  changing the hitbox variables for the enemies so they died when they 
interacted with the orb
5.  making the orb apper with a key command
6.  making the orb apper from the character and not elsewhere
7.  fixing so the orb doesn't travel to far from the player
8.  importing the image in a diffrent size then what it was
9.  didn't change from the actual player class and the player object
10. geting the orb class to fuction with the rest of the code
