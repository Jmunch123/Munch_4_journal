Year 29 was the most difficult level to me due to the fact how you moved 
letters on the floor by place numbers that each letter was positioned on, and 
than putting those letters into the outbox one of the most difficult parts in 
this game by far.

Approaching a problem with more of a positive attitude and allowing yourself 
to tinker around with the newly based code allowed me to exell throughout the 
game.

The majorities of the problem  consisted of mathmatics in which you would have
to multiply or add to get the answer, so with my basic skills that I've learned 
from math classes I used the basic methods that the game provided and solved the
problems.

When I anwsered the question in some of the years, only the code that I had worked 
with some imput sequences, knowing this I back tracked and rewrote the code to find 
the issue, sometimes it would have been a jump error, but ocasionally it was a very 
silly mistake
