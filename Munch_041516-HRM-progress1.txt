Year 29 was the most difficult level to me due to the fact how you moved 
letters on the floor by place numbers that each letter was positioned on, and 
than putting those letters into the outbox one of the most difficult parts in 
this game by far.

Approaching a problem with more of a positive attitude and allowing yourself 
to tinker around with the newly based code allowed me to exell throughout the 
game.
