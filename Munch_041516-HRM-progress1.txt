My biggest Challenge in HRM was year 19 where every number in the inbox had 
to count down or up to 0. 

The previous year taught how to remove the negative symbol from a number in 
the inbox, how I solved this is that I established several jumbs after 
the inbox to set it onto either 0,1,or 2 than I subtracted twice which helped 
prepare me for year 19
