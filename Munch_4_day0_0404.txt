We have altered the song in example 11, and are going to imput that song into the final product.
We need to add lights to the specific tones in the song. 
On Friday, we will turn in the rough draft of our project. 
We are adding some code from both example 1 and 11 and trying to add them together to form a song in which the lights will flash to a specific beat. 
We have created no new fuctions so far.
