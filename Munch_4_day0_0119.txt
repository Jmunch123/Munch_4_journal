I created The Maze which is a knight trying to find the exit before he is 
consumed by the hedge maze

I solved several animation and image incorperating codes and issues 
throughout this project but cannot solve the enemy ai

no because i thought we would have time to create the maze and character and 
start coding later

Sort of i did finish everything but the enemy ai when it was due friday.
