Create a class for 'hero'
The class should contain:
variables for health, score, power/weapon, dexterity, perception, level, x, y, z, and a symbol
There should also be a class constructor accepting inputs for name, x, y, and symbol

public class Hero{

public static int Health = 25;
pulbic static int Score = 0;
public static boolean weapon = false;
public static int dexterity = 30;
public static int perception = 40;
public static int level;
public static int x,y,z;
public static int symbol;

public Hero(int x , int y, int symbol){
	walkcycle = x;
	camera = y;
	$ = symbol;

}

}

Provide an example of initializing a hero object with your name

public class hero{
public static int name;
Scanner Name = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("What is your name");
name = Name.nextInt();
}

Explain why you would not initialize the hero in class hero.

The reason why the hero class shouldn't be initalized in class hero is because if it is 
intialized in class hero the variables that are used in that class  will have to be 
constantly called from that class into a method or other class if it is intitalized in 
the main class than all the code would be able to use the variables in class hero freely.
