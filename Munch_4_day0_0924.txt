Steven Ballmer called GPL a virus Steven said " if you use any open-source
software you have to make the rest of the software open source" meaning if
you made one protion of code open-source you would have to go back and make
it all open-source causing loss of time and more work.

open-source software is accessable to anyone to modify and change, while 
proprietary software is owned by an individual of company and is kept a secret
and never to be changed.

a gpl is a copyleft license only work could be made through the same terms
while a mit license is a free software license that could make copies of
software if provided that they fallow the terms of copyright notice.
