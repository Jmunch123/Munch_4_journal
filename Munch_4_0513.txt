I had no idea that the slick assignment and the 2-d array were alike in the
way that we programed them until I saw the requirements for the game

1. how do you declare a method
2. how do you initialize a class
3. write the code to allow enemies to chase after you
4. what is a class constucter
5. how would you program a skill for the player/ enemy
6. what code did you write to make the traps not visible
7. how would you postpone curtain story elements
8. use java to draw out a 2-d array
9. what is the diffrence from a 2-d array and a 3-d array
10. would you write all the code in the main?
