Java is object oriented programming while C is fuction oriented. Most classes 
are similar throughout the code like void and methods. Code commenting is the 
same.

I will alter the speed of the light as its blinking to make it either slower 
or faster in the future.

For a circuit are you talking about what is nessacary for the board to run a 
program or something diffrent?

The circit uses C and complies curtain parts of the board to meet to a specific 
purpose

The projects that we have completed consisted of several variations of lights 
and sounds using the circuit board. The lights either change in brightness, 
flicker on and off or light up at a certain time, doing so very specificly.
I've leared about the several parts inside the kit and how they fuction due to
the several examples that the book requires you to do. I have also been 
exposed to a new programming language that the board runs on (which is C) 
and how it fuctions through the program it runs on and the circuit itself. 
That is what ive learned so far in this constructing a circuit project.
