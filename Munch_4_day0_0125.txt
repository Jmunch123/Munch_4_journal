Everything was great with the production of the game untill the part where we 
imported the code for the enemy ai but everything like recreating the end and 
menu screen but the ai was the most difficult part in the whole project.

I first started to incorperate the code and drew the ai but the difficult part
was making the ai move around randomly but when i asked around my neighbors 
they helped me create the movement animations for the ai but I fiddled around ]
with the movement code and boom they started randomly walking around the maze
