I plan to try and make a certain color strand with several shapes and colors
most likely i would change the values of the methods and how they will change 
the project
I would alter it so it could incorperate how the methods would change the 
outcome of the code
I would probably not and an else but the if and else if would go in to 
where the info would change the for loop output of the code
algebra and graphic location
