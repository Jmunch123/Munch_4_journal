A method is something that takes information and runs of the main branch of 
information
I used the main to establish the main information the whole project runs on, 
and plathegame method uses this info and manipulates it to run the game
A while loop is a program that keeps runing until it is proven false or till 
you chose to stop it
my while loop play again is limited to 7  tries in my game when the tries go 
over 7 the game ends with a gameover try again.
