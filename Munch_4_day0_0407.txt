The 3 things that I have learned about cs with Arduino is how to manipulate 
the tone of sounds with the buzzard, how to make light flash with specific 
sounds and creating a song with the code. 
The usage of sound in code was a surprise to me as we started this project. 
We started creating a song by manipulating the tones of the buzzes to fit in 
to specific notes in the song. We did this by setting a arraylist for the 
notes and established those notes with specific buzz pitches.
The way the light flashes with the song is a result of putting the code for 
the light near the end of the loop method. Every time there is a buzz the 
light flashes a millisecond after the buzz. 
Establishing this after the delay for each buzz allowed the light to flash 
after each buzz in the song.
Putting the playTone, playNote, setup, and loop methods establish the code to 
organize in order, the board scans the playTone, and playNote methods to gain 
the pitches and length of the song. After words you set up the breadboard for 
the specific parts needed to play the song, and the loop continues the song 
over and over again.
