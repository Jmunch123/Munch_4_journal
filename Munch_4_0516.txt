Explain casting. Up-casting, Down-casting.
Casting is taking an object of one certain type and turning it into another 
object type
Up-casting puts the object into a diffrent group but it still functions as 
that object. 
Down-casting allows the object to seperate from the specific grouping, 
allowing the properties of that object to be manipulated once more


Give a specific code example for up-casting, and down-casting.
class Animal {
	int health = 100;
}

class Mammal extends Animal { }

class Cat extends Mammal { }

class Dog extends Mammal { }

public class Test {	 
	 public static void main(String[] args) {
		 Cat c = new Cat();
		 System.out.println(c.health);
		 Dog d = new Dog();
		 System.out.println(d.health);
	 }  
}
Give a specific code example for converting a char to a String
String stringValueOf = String.valueOf('c');
or
String stringValueOfCharArray = String.valueOf(new char[]{x});
What is the range of values for byte? Why?
-128 to 127, because negative integers are represented in a system called two's
 complement, which allows easier arithmetic processing in hardware, and also 
eliminates the potential ambiguity of having positive zero and negative zero.
