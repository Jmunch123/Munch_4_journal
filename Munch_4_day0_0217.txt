1. To initialize and declare items into the code
2. It looks like this:
intArray(0) = 1;
3. It looks like this:
ThisStringArray(0) = "String";
4. It looks like this:
ThisArrayBoolean[0] = true;
5.it looks like this:
ThisDoubleArray[] = new DoubleArray[]
6.intArray(42) = 42;
7.ThisStringArray(0) = "Bob";
8.This does not do anything due to the string not having a 3rd word
9.This allows a list in which the string[] postres could choice to print
10.One is the code to print the list while the other is the list
11. Then the 2nd word would be apple pie instead of bunuelos
