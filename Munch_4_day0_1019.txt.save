I am about the quarter of the way done with my methods.
I was either focusing on all the knowlege that was being explained or becoming
lost in all the knowledge that was pownding my brain
sort of not the all the time but when I searched around for directions I 
definitly found some that lead me through the project
Yes I have and I did to see if my code followed up with the reqirements for
the project 
gc.setFill(Color.RED);
gc.fillRect(50,50,10,10)
gc.fillRect(60,60,10,10)
gc.fillRect(70,70,10,10)
