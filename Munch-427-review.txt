We are encouraged to learn computer science because it is a extremely enhanced way of
learning how to teach ourselves things. It teaches us that we need to tinker with things
and that we need to work on our own to solve our problems and not just hope to be handed the work.

We should learn that we will not always have help, and we won't always have the exact
answer online to solve our problems, so we need to fix our own problems.
