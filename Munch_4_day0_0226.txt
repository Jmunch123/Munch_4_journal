this code uses the size of the map to print out either '.' or 'map[i][j]' by 
selecting a map with the value of zero and using integers to be either equal 
or less than zero.

change i to equal 3 and the integer j would become 2 thus printing out x

change the x to equal 5 and change the integers to equal the values that are 
displayed in the array and it would print out as 5
